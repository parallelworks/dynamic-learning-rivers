# First, get list of sites we want to filter out (already observed):
obsfile="../input_data/ICON-ModEx_Sites_To_Remove.csv"

# Second, build a list of sites to remove based on the above file.
# Remove the MP- prefix from the list, (but allow all SP- to remain!)
# (Matches Sample_ID format)
# Skip the header line
# Prefix all Sample_ID with "-e ^"<SAMPLE_ID>"," to force search at beginning of line
# and end with a comma to force avoiding confusing SP-5 with SP-50.
# Sort all and remove any diplicates
obslist=$(sed 's/MP-//g' $obsfile | awk ' NR > 1 {print "-e ^"$1","}' | sort | uniq )

# Third, apply the filters. There are two:
# 1) Remove all CM_, SSS, S19S_ sites because those are observations and
# 2) Remove the sites listed in the obslist, above. For the obslist filter,
#    Need to ensure -e is present (-e's are added above)
#  Need to put Sample_ID in rightmost
#  column so it is not interpreted as a lon,lat
#  grep -v means invert selection  (i.e. remove the matches)
#  Skip over header line with NR > 1 in the awk command.
#  Remove all "SP-" prefixes because they are converted to NaN by GMT later
#  The SP- prefixes will be reinserted.
