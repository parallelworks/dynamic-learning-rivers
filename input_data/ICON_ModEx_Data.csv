Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50% filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials/bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler. Apologies - we had a team of 5 doing the sampling (and it took 2 hours).

The river sediment was so fine that getting it through the filters was incredibly difficult (especially when using a 50 ml syringe) and therefore we used many filters. It would have been easier to use smaller syringes, but trying to fill a 500 ml bottle with a small syringe would have been tedious). Therefore the ""filtered water"" sample (BWT - filtered) had to be filled with non-filtered water. We managed to fill it to nearly 150 ml of filtered water, but it took 30 mins and we couldn't do that 3-4 more times. Therefore, we filled the remaining 400 ml with unfiltered water. Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50% filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials/bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler. Apologies - we had a team of 5 doing the sampling (and it took 2 hours).

There was a steep incline up to a terrace (but it was not more than 4 m long) and the terrace was vegetated with hardwoods (dominated by Platanus occidentalis). Most importantly, there was a dry, ephemeral tributary at the ""real"" bank (see sensor notes above)nearest to area we sampled. There was evidence of erosional deposition present.
