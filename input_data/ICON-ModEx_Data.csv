- the written notes list the U-M distance as 5m (should be 10m). and D-M distance as 10m (should be 5m).
- access to sunlight: D and M have no shade (0% shading and 100% sunlight. instead of 100% canopy cover). The upstream site (U) has about 50% shading. 
Pictures: given the turbidity of the water. no pictures of the sediment could be taken. Sediments were collected by diving down into the water and scooping up sediment. The pictures uploaded represent the setting on land. not in the river. Sediment samples at D and M were fairly muddy. several sediment scoops at the upstream site contained a fair amount of leaves that were removed. 
Filter: the filter clogged after running the second set of replicates and at that point. we switched to the second filter (keeping the first filter clean). Filtering became difficult quickly again and filling vial ICR3 was challenging. When collecting samples for the third replicate for cations (CAT3). the sample collapsed (air might have gotten into the filter?) and water passed through the filter much more easily. We continued sampling CAT3. but the sample is much darker in color. indicating that the filter didn't work. and I suggest to discard that sample. We continued to filter the 125mL vial at the very end (S19S_0011_MER). After a little while. the filtering became harder again. so we discarded the water in it. filtered some more (~10mL). rinsed the bottle with that water and discarded it. and then filtered the required ~125mL. Thus. that sample *may* be valid. Given the above issues with filter #2. we preserved the first filter for microbial analyses with RNALater.",,,False,
