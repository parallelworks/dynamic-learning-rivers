# dynamic-learning-rivers/examples

This directory contains the following:
1. `superlearner.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that uses an already trained SuperLearner model to make predictions.
2. `ModEx_reproducibility`: directory containing scripts for creating input files (i.e. training data subsets)
   for reruns of the ML workflow. These were used in the manuscript to generate hindcast ML models and ML models
   trained on the highest/lowest priority data points.
