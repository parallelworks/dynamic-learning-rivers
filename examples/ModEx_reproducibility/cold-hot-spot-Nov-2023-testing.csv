Pictures: given the turbidity of the water. no pictures of the sediment could be taken. Sediments were collected by diving down into the water and scooping up sediment. The pictures uploaded represent the setting on land. not in the river. Sediment samples at D and M were fairly muddy. several sediment scoops at the upstream site contained a fair amount of leaves that were removed. 
Filter: the filter clogged after running the second set of replicates and at that point. we switched to the second filter (keeping the first filter clean). Filtering became difficult quickly again and filling vial ICR3 was challenging. When collecting samples for the third replicate for cations (CAT3). the sample collapsed (air might have gotten into the filter?) and water passed through the filter much more easily. We continued sampling CAT3. but the sample is much darker in color. indicating that the filter didn't work. and I suggest to discard that sample. We continued to filter the 125mL vial at the very end (S19S_0011_MER). After a little while. the filtering became harder again. so we discarded the water in it. filtered some more (~10mL). rinsed the bottle with that water and discarded it. and then filtered the required ~125mL. Thus. that sample *may* be valid. Given the above issues with filter #2. we preserved the first filter for microbial analyses with RNALater.",,,False,

I provided a diagram (sketch) of the site with estimated distances in the uploaded files section in this form.The bank was level with fine and course sediments - if vegetation was present it was grasses on the bank (grasses appeared to be some Phragmites sp. and/or Paspalum denticulatum). There was a steep incline up to a terrace (but it was not more than 4 m long) and the terrace was vegetated with hardwoods (dominated by Platanus occidentalis). Most importantly, there was a dry, ephemeral tributary at the ""real"" bank (see sensor notes above)nearest to area we sampled. There was evidence of erosional deposition present. The source of the ravine/tributary was a bare/muddy watering area of a densely populated cattle ranch. The river sediment was so fine that getting it through the filters was incredibly difficult (especially when using a 50 ml syringe) and therefore we used many filters. It would have been easier to use smaller syringes, but trying to fill a 500 ml bottle with a small syringe would have been tedious). Therefore the ""filtered water"" sample (BWT - filtered) had to be filled with non-filtered water. We managed to fill it to nearly 150 ml of filtered water, but it took 30 mins and we couldn't do that 3-4 more times. Therefore, we filled the remaining 400 ml with unfiltered water. Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50% filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials/bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler. Apologies - we had a team of 5 doing the sampling (and it took 2 hours).
