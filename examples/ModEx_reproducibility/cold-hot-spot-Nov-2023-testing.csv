- the written notes list the U-M distance as 5m (should be 10m). and D-M distance as 10m (should be 5m).
- access to sunlight: D and M have no shade (0% shading and 100% sunlight. instead of 100% canopy cover). The upstream site (U) has about 50% shading. 
Pictures: given the turbidity of the water. no pictures of the sediment could be taken. Sediments were collected by diving down into the water and scooping up sediment. The pictures uploaded represent the setting on land. not in the river. Sediment samples at D and M were fairly muddy. several sediment scoops at the upstream site contained a fair amount of leaves that were removed. 
Filter: the filter clogged after running the second set of replicates and at that point. we switched to the second filter (keeping the first filter clean). Filtering became difficult quickly again and filling vial ICR3 was challenging. When collecting samples for the third replicate for cations (CAT3). the sample collapsed (air might have gotten into the filter?) and water passed through the filter much more easily. We continued sampling CAT3. but the sample is much darker in color. indicating that the filter didn't work. and I suggest to discard that sample. We continued to filter the 125mL vial at the very end (S19S_0011_MER). After a little while. the filtering became harder again. so we discarded the water in it. filtered some more (~10mL). rinsed the bottle with that water and discarded it. and then filtered the required ~125mL. Thus. that sample *may* be valid. Given the above issues with filter #2. we preserved the first filter for microbial analyses with RNALater.",,,False,

I have extensive experience working in the upper 20 km of the Lower Colorado downstream from Longhorn Dam. and can confirm that the conditions at our sampling site are representative of the river conditions near the USGS gauge. There are no major inflows between the sampling site and the USGS gauge so river conditions at the gauge are also representative of conditions at the sampling site.,,,False,

Most importantly, there was a dry, ephemeral tributary at the ""real"" bank (see sensor notes above)nearest to area we sampled. There was evidence of erosional deposition present. The source of the ravine/tributary was a bare/muddy watering area of a densely populated cattle ranch. The river sediment was so fine that getting it through the filters was incredibly difficult (especially when using a 50 ml syringe) and therefore we used many filters. It would have been easier to use smaller syringes, but trying to fill a 500 ml bottle with a small syringe would have been tedious). Therefore the ""filtered water"" sample (BWT - filtered) had to be filled with non-filtered water. We managed to fill it to nearly 150 ml of filtered water, but it took 30 mins and we couldn't do that 3-4 more times. Therefore, we filled the remaining 400 ml with unfiltered water. Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50% filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials/bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler. Apologies - we had a team of 5 doing the sampling (and it took 2 hours). Collection photo - difficult to get 1 m2 since the whole team is super short.",https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=fwd&gage=hibt2&hydro_type=0,,False,

We thus sampled water from a fishing deck several feet south to the boat ramp. The water at the fishing deck was very deep, and water was full of sediments. We had to replace a filter for every two syringes of water. Because water was deep at the fishing dock, we took sediment samples at the boat ramp, where the sediment is mainly gravel. It took us a long time to filter fine sands for sampling. Due to the muddy river water and gravel sediments, it thus took us about 2.5 hours to finish the sampling.
