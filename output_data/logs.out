Step 1: Local setup on PW platform
Execution is in /home/sfgary/pw/jobs/sl_core/00155/workflow.sh at Mon Jul 1 06:37:36 PM UTC 2024
 
Workflow parameters from workflow.xml, apirun/main.py, or ./github/workflows/main.yaml:
These parameters are command line arguments when invoking this script and
are likely to be blank due to the usage of inputs.sh replacing command line arguments.
